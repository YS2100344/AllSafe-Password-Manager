# AllSafe Password Management Application README

## Introduction

Developed using C++, the AllSafe Password Management Application is designed with the primary objective of securely storing passwords directly on a user's local computer. It ensures that access is tightly controlled and limited to authorized users via a master password system. By implementing an encryption algorithm, the application converts all user passwords into encoded formats. This encoding process makes the stored passwords unrecognizable and inaccessible to anyone without the proper decryption key, thereby safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access. The application stands as a reliable tool for users looking to enhance their digital security by maintaining a secure repository of their various passwords, each obscured through encryption to ensure privacy and protection.
